# Living designs, Ditz tasks and agent context

A design states how the system fits together. A task records a bounded change and
its dependencies. An agent draft turns a deliberate task/source selection into
instructions. These link to one another, but they are not interchangeable records.

## Lower-level map

| Part | Source of truth | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design/component hierarchy | [.swarm/plans.json](../../.swarm/plans.json) and component documents | [protocol/plans.ts](../../protocol/plans.ts), [core/plans.ts](../../core/plans.ts), [PlanWorkspace](../../app/renderer/plans/PlanWorkspace.tsx) |
| Tasks and blockage | Ditz YAML on `ditz-metadata` | [git-reader.ts](../../core/tasks/git-reader.ts), [metadata.ts](../../core/tasks/metadata.ts), [TaskGraph](../../app/renderer/tasks/TaskGraph.tsx) |
| Task detail and links | Revision-pinned task observation | [TaskDetail](../../app/renderer/tasks/TaskDetail.tsx), [TaskContext](../../app/renderer/tasks/TaskContext.tsx) |
| Prepared task context | Fixed attachment plus selected source | [draft-context.ts](../../core/tasks/draft-context.ts), [protocol/agent-task.ts](../../protocol/agent-task.ts) |

Plan relationships are authored in-repo. The core reads a bounded canonical
index and validates its structure; a reference remains a candidate until its
target can actually be opened. The accompanying component graph descends to the
actual source and Bazel boundaries instead of manufacturing a function inventory.

Ditz reads are pinned to metadata revisions. Missing relationships and partial
coverage must not turn into fabricated “ready” tasks. Updating metadata does not
silently retarget a draft: the operator explicitly refreshes, attaches and prepares
again. The core materializes the selected task text rather than trusting arbitrary
renderer-supplied task bytes. Admitted run history keeps the task actually used.

## Build connections

`.swarm/**`, plan/task protocol, core and renderer files feed `//:quality_sources`
and then `//:desktop-bundle`. `//tools/demo-plans:regressions` consumes that
filegroup; `//tools/demo-plans:packaged-plans-test` consumes the desktop bundle,
plan test sources, task-integration sources and owned virtual-desktop support.
These edges are declared in [tools/demo-plans/BUILD.bazel](../../tools/demo-plans/BUILD.bazel).
Markdown documents are repository content read when opened, not compiled service
targets. The root source filegroup does not currently glob all `docs/**`.

When code changes, update the corresponding document, graph links and build-label
mapping together. Completion notes should record what was accomplished in Ditz;
the online Work Log writer is a planned part of [this increment](../swarm-operator-hour.md).
