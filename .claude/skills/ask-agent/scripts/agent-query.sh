# agent-query.sh - Query an AI agent non-interactively (piped mode)
#
# Usage: agent-query.sh <agent> [options] <prompt>
#        agent-query.sh <agent> [options] --prompt-file <file>
#
# Agents: claude, codex, agy (Antigravity CLI)
#
# Options:
#   -d, --dir <dir>              Set working directory
#   -m, --model <model>          Specify model (agent-specific)
#   -f, --prompt-file <file>     Read prompt from file (avoids ARG_MAX)
#   -r, --resume <id>            Continue an existing session instead of a new one
#   -S, --session-id-file <file> Write the session id this run YIELDED to <file>
#
# For claude and codex the prompt is piped via stdin, never passed as a CLI
# argument, which avoids ARG_MAX limits on execve(2).
#
# agy has no stdin mode. Rather than put the prompt in argv -- which would cap
# it at 128 KiB and expose it in `ps` -- the script stages it in a private temp
# directory and passes agy a path plus --add-dir. See the agy branch below.
#
# --resume maps to each agent's own continuation flag (claude --resume, codex
# exec resume, agy --conversation). All three APPEND to the existing session
# rather than forking it, so the yielded id equals the requested one. The
# non-mutating alternatives -- `codex exec fork`, `claude --fork-session` -- are
# deliberately not wrapped: a council round wants the seat's history to
# accumulate. See docs/ask-agent-session-resume.md for the evidence.
#
# --session-id-file exists because two of the three agents only reveal the id
# they generated in output the caller cannot reliably parse. The file gets the
# bare id and a newline, nothing else -- or is left EMPTY when the run produced
# nothing safe to chain, so a failed round can never leave the PREVIOUS round's
# id there for the next one to pick up. It is written by atomic rename at the
# end, so a run that dies before reaching an agent leaves it untouched.
#
# Exit status is the agent's own, with two additions:
#   3  agy exited 0 but its reply did not carry the end-of-prompt sentinel, i.e.
#      it may have answered without reading the staged prompt to the end.
#   4  --resume was asked for and the run did not demonstrably land in that
#      session. Only reachable for agy, which answers an unknown conversation id
#      by silently starting a NEW conversation and exiting 0 (codex and claude
#      both exit 1 on an unknown id, so their own status already says so).
#   5  the run was fine but the id could not be written where --session-id-file
#      asked. Distinct because a caller that only checks the status would
#      otherwise read the PREVIOUS round's id back out and chain onto it.
# All three print the reply anyway. 3 outranks 4 outranks 5; the agent's own
# non-zero status outranks all of them.
#
# Examples:
#   agent-query.sh claude "Explain this error"
#   agent-query.sh codex -d ./project "Review the auth module"
#   agent-query.sh codex --model o3 "Optimize this function"
#   agent-query.sh agy "Summarize this codebase"
#   agent-query.sh claude --prompt-file /tmp/review-prompt.txt
#   agent-query.sh codex --session-id-file /tmp/sid "Round 1: review this diff"
#   agent-query.sh codex --resume "$(cat /tmp/sid)" "Round 2: re-check your findings"

# A session id reaches argv of the downstream CLI, so it is checked before it
# gets there rather than trusted. Nothing here is about shell injection -- every
# command is built as an array and never eval'd -- it is about the two ways a
# malformed id turns into a wrong answer rather than an error:
#
#   * an id starting with "-" is read by the agent as a FLAG. `--resume -m` would
#     silently become a model override on a fresh session, i.e. exactly the cold
#     context this option exists to avoid, with no diagnostic.
#   * whitespace or a newline breaks the id back out of its own line, which is
#     the format --session-id-file promises and the agy comparison below relies
#     on -- an id with a trailing newline would never compare equal to the one
#     agy logs, turning every resume into a spurious exit 4.
#
# UUIDs are what all three actually mint, but codex also accepts a thread NAME
# where an id goes, so the class is kept a little wider than UUID and no wider.
#
# An EMPTY id is rejected rather than quietly meaning "fresh". The intended
# calling shape is `--resume "$(cat sid)"`, and that sid file is deliberately
# left EMPTY whenever a previous round could not determine its id -- so treating
# empty as "no resume requested" would turn the one case that most needs a
# diagnostic into a silent cold-context run. Which is the whole failure this

# the session leaves an id for a session that never existed. That is survivable
# precisely because claude and codex both exit 1 on an unknown id -- the next

# handled the other way round: its id is read back out and verified.)

# allocates for `{var}>` -- verified: a child's /proc/self/fd showed both fd 2
# and the raw fd 10 on the same pipe. The raw one is invisible to the child's
# own redirections, so it propagates to every descendant even one that points
# its stdio elsewhere, and tee then waits on the longest-lived grandchild
# rather than on codex.
# Backgrounding also means bash sets INT and QUIT to SIG_IGN in the child, so
# an interactive Ctrl-C no longer reaches codex directly the way it did through
# `exec`. wait_forwarding_signals forwards TERM and HUP, which is what
# `timeout` and tmux actually send; the capture path accepts the difference.

# POLL for the banner rather than `wait`ing on tee. Even with the fd closed
# above, any descendant of codex that inherited stderr -- an MCP server, a
# sandbox helper, a command the model backgrounded -- keeps the pipe open, so
# tee may never see EOF at all. An unbounded wait there parks the wrapper until
# `timeout` kills it, which reports a round codex answered perfectly well as a
# timeout AND loses the id that was already sitting in the file. The banner is
# written in the first moments of the run, so it is there or it is not.
#
# Anchored at the start of a line, and only within the banner block. codex
# echoes the PROMPT to stderr as well, and a prompt quoting this repo's own
# docs contains literal "session id: <uuid>" lines -- exactly what a council
# review of this PR sends. Matching those would resume a session the prompt
# chose.
# The block BETWEEN the banner's two delimiter lines, which is where codex puts
# the id and is structurally before its echo of the prompt. A line cutoff would
# have to trade a false negative (a long preamble pushes the banner past it)
# against a false positive (a short adversarial prompt lands inside it); the
# delimiters have neither problem.
# The window is NOT shortened when codex exited non-zero, tempting as that is
# (a missing binary exits 127 instantly and then costs five seconds of polling
# for a banner that will never come). A run can print a perfectly good banner
# and THEN fail fast -- an auth error, an unknown model, a refused sandbox --
# and tee has had microseconds to flush it. Keying the poll on the exit status
# reintroduces exactly the tee race the poll exists to survive, and trades a
# five-second delay on an error path for a lost session id on a real one.
